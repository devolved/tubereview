# Tube Review - Youtube channel review site

**Node / Express / MongoDB / Handlebars**

Making this up as I go along, so no roadmap but have a few features that spring to mind

- Add: Fetch YouTube data on either URL or channel name add (not sure which is more noob proof)
- Add: Preview in aside on fetch data
- Review: Theme reviews with channel art
- Review: Add channel info such as sub count
- Channels: List of channels reviewed with review count
- Channels: Reviewed by list
- Channels: Preview of top (or only) review
- User: Top reviewers > review the reviewers (oooh meta!)
- User: login > top reviews etc etc
